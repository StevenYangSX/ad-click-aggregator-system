Problem Statement
As the volume of incoming event data continues to grow exponentially, the current system struggles with processing, aggregating, and providing real-time insights. This has led to increased latency and delayed data processing, which affects business-critical decision-making. The core problem lies in the need for a system that can handle billions of events per day with real-time aggregation and querying capabilities while maintaining low operational costs and ensuring scalability.

This proposal aims to design a backend system that addresses these issues by implementing a scalable architecture capable of processing high-throughput event data with low-latency requirements, using modern technologies like Kafka for message streaming, high-performance storage solutions, and efficient aggregation services.

Background
The current system handles events from multiple sources and processes millions to billions of events daily. As the data volume increases, so do the performance bottlenecks in aggregation, storage, and querying. The existing architecture lacks the scalability and efficiency to handle these demands. Latency issues arise from processing delays, particularly during peak loads, where users experience slower query responses.

This proposal will introduce a highly scalable architecture that leverages event-driven processing, efficient data aggregation, and fast storage access, all while maintaining data accuracy and operational efficiency. The goal is to meet the growing demand for real-time data insights.

Tenets
Scalability: The system must handle billions of events per day, scaling horizontally with minimal degradation in performance.
Low Latency: Event aggregation and query readiness should occur within minutes, and ideally in seconds for real-time scenarios.
Data Accuracy: Even under high loads, the aggregation system must ensure the accuracy of the aggregated data.
Resilience: The system must handle failures gracefully with mechanisms for data recovery and fault tolerance.
Cost Efficiency: The architecture should minimize resource consumption while ensuring high throughput.
Design - High Level to Low Level
System Overview
Browser/User Interface

Tech Stack: HTML, JavaScript, RESTful API
Users interact with the system via the browser, where they submit queries or interact with a UI that visualizes aggregated data. These queries are sent to the backend via RESTful APIs. This decouples the front-end from the backend, allowing independent scaling.
API Layer

Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Java, REST API
This layer serves as the communication bridge between the frontend and backend services. It exposes several APIs, including:
/api/aggregate: To request data aggregation across different events.
/api/filtered_events: To filter and retrieve aggregated data based on specific parameters like time range or event type.
Why Spring Boot: We chose Spring Boot for its flexibility and ability to handle high-performance RESTful services. It integrates well with modern backend architectures, provides scalability, and has built-in monitoring capabilities.

Kafka Message Queue

Tech Stack: Apache Kafka
Kafka is used for asynchronous data processing, enabling the system to handle event streams in real-time. It is responsible for ensuring that incoming data from the API layer is quickly delivered to the appropriate aggregation services without causing bottlenecks.
Why Kafka: Kafka is highly scalable and fault-tolerant, allowing for reliable message delivery and handling massive amounts of real-time event data. It provides high throughput for streaming data pipelines and guarantees fault tolerance, ensuring no event data is lost.

Aggregation Services

Tech Stack: Apache Flink or Apache Spark for real-time stream processing
Aggregation services consume data from Kafka and perform operations such as time-based aggregation, filtering, and summarization (e.g., event counts, metrics over time). This service processes high volumes of incoming data, aggregates it based on predefined rules, and stores it in a format optimized for fast querying.
Why Flink/Spark: Both Apache Flink and Spark are designed for distributed data processing with low-latency, real-time processing capabilities. Flink is particularly suited for continuous stream processing, while Spark is effective for both batch and stream processing. Flink is preferred for its true event-time processing, allowing for precise, low-latency results.

Storage

Tech Stack: NoSQL (Cassandra) + Time-Series Database (TimescaleDB)
Aggregated data is stored in two types of databases:
Cassandra: Used for storing high-volume, high-throughput event data that requires fast write performance and horizontal scalability. This NoSQL database is optimized for handling large-scale event streams.
TimescaleDB: A time-series database used for storing time-based aggregated data. This allows efficient querying of time-based metrics and supports SQL, which simplifies querying processes.
Why Cassandra: Cassandra provides the necessary scalability and performance for real-time, high-frequency data writes, ensuring the system can scale horizontally without impacting read/write performance.
Why TimescaleDB: For time-based aggregation queries, TimescaleDB excels at handling large volumes of time-series data with high performance, making it ideal for efficient storage and retrieval of aggregated metrics.

Monitoring & Alerts

Tech Stack: Prometheus, Grafana
Monitoring tools like Prometheus are integrated to collect metrics on system performance (e.g., event throughput, processing latency). Grafana provides dashboards that visualize real-time data and alert on anomalies, ensuring operational teams can monitor the system's health and performance.
Alternate Design Options
Batch Processing

Pros: Simpler architecture, less computationally intensive at non-peak hours.
Cons: Higher latency, as data would only be aggregated after set intervals.
Reason for rejection: Real-time insights are critical for the business. Batch processing introduces delays that make it unsuitable for the required low-latency operations.
Traditional RDBMS vs. NoSQL + Time-Series DB

Pros of RDBMS: Simplified architecture, well-established systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Cons: Limited scalability for high-throughput events, performance degradation with large datasets.
Reason for rejection: The system requires horizontal scalability and high throughput, which RDBMS solutions cannot provide efficiently at this scale.
AB/Metrics
Throughput: The system should handle over 10 billion events per day with processing speeds upwards of 10,000 events per second.

Latency: Aggregation and querying should complete within 1-2 minutes, with real-time stream processing showing results in seconds.

Storage: Storage should optimize for both write-heavy workloads (event ingestion) and read-heavy workloads (queries).

AB Testing: We will perform AB testing to compare the performance improvements between the existing system and the proposed architecture, focusing on response times, system throughput, and overall user experience in querying real-time data.

Migrations
Dual-Write System: During the migration, a dual-write system will be employed where the old system writes to both legacy storage and the new aggregation system, ensuring consistency. Once testing is completed, the legacy system will be fully retired.
Data Backfill: Historical event data will be batch-imported into the new system during non-peak hours. Flink or Spark can be leveraged to quickly process and backfill large datasets into the new system.
Client-Specific Considerations
Resource Consumption: Kafka, Flink/Spark, and Cassandra clusters must be properly sized and optimized to minimize costs while meeting performance requirements. The system will automatically scale during peak traffic periods to ensure resource usage efficiency.

Cost Implications: Using open-source technologies like Kafka, Cassandra, and Flink minimizes licensing costs, but the infrastructure needs to be robust to handle operational scaling. Cloud-native solutions (AWS, GCP, etc.) may be leveraged for elastic scaling during peak times.

Server-Specific Considerations
Cost Optimization: Costs will primarily stem from storage, compute resources for Flink/Spark, and Kafka clusters. Using managed services for Kafka and Cassandra (e.g., AWS MSK, Google Cloud Datastore) may reduce operational overhead.
Security: The system must comply with organizational data security policies. Communication between services will use encrypted channels (SSL/TLS), and access controls will be enforced using OAuth for the API layer.
Privacy
The system does not handle sensitive personal data directly. However, aggregated metrics may contain business-critical information, so data encryption at rest and in transit will be mandatory.

Security
No significant security concerns were identified. All API endpoints will be secured using industry-standard authentication protocols, and data within the system will be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

Stakeholders
Engineering Team: Responsible for the development of the aggregation services, API integration, and monitoring tools.
Data Analysts: Ensuring the accuracy of aggregated data and defining the metrics for aggregation.
DevOps: Setting up Kafka, Cassandra, and monitoring the system's performance.
Product Team: Ensuring the system meets the business requirements for real-time insights and aggregation.
Testing
End-to-End Testing: Integration tests will be conducted to ensure data flows seamlessly from the API through Kafka, into aggregation services, and storage.
Load Testing: Load tests will simulate peak traffic to verify that the system meets performance and scalability targets.
Rollout Plan
Phase 1: Initial deployment of the new system in parallel with the existing one. Data will flow into both systems for comparison.
Phase 2: Begin routing a percentage of user traffic
